This repository contains code to build the batmapper plugin for batclient. ( http://www.bat.org/play/batclient )

#### How to build & run it locally #

Feel free to submit pull requests, there is lots of room for improvement. Preferably use the github issues etc   

If you feel you must, you can try to contact me ingame in batmud too, but I rarely spend time there,
